      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup
        Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications.
        HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link
         within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which 
         brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText 
         is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
         A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout 
         and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text
         more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
         With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
         HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages
          with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser.
           An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which 
        is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup
         language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with
        HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be
         used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
         CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user
         interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
         Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border
          and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process.
          CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change
         the entire website by changing just one file. CSS provides more detailed attributes
          than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.

      <h2>JavaScripts</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by 
        several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming 
        language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. 
        It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
        Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, 
        users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
        The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
        Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. 
        The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. 
        In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
